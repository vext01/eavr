Edd's AVR Libraries
===================

This is a growing collection of general purpose C code for use on AVR
microcontroller boards, including Arduino.

For now this is just a collection of programs and Makefiles, however, in the
future an effort will be made to create shared libaries in the correct PREFIX
with header files. This will mean making all parameters runtime configurable
rather than compile time configurable (as they are now). Also an autoconf build
system will eventually be added.

Hope the code is useful. If you liked it, send me an email.
